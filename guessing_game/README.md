A simple web-based “Guess the Number” game built with Flask.
The server generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. 
Feedback is given for each guess (“Too low!”, “Too high!”, or “Correct!”). The game can be restarted at any time.
It was implemented purely to practice Flask templates and routes.
